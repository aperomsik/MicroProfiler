# MicroProfiler

I previously had a repo here mirrored from googlecode.com using git-svn. 

To the small handful of people who were following development here: Now that the author has migrated 
MicroProfiler development to github, I have deleted my import and will fork his version.

If you have a local clone, you can switch to the official upstream as follows:

    git remote add upstream git@github.com:tyoma/micro-profiler.git
    git fetch upstream
